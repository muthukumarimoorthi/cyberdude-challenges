Kundarakudi temple was a very surprise element in my trip which you got added at the last moment. This temple is located on a big rock. what is interesting is that every steps has a footmark carved on it and some large steps of carvings of her entire human body. It is easy to climb the temple, hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes. below the rock there are caves with beautiful carvings and paintings in natural colors. It is a protected monument visited by very few people but it is definitely a must see when visiting kundrakudi.
